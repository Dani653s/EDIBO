DAY 04  
USING SHELL VARIABLES  
variable_name=variable_value    
NAME="Zara Ali" - example    
Script -    
#!/bin/sh  
  
NAME="Zara Ali"  
echo $NAME  
This script will produce -   
Zara Ali  

SPECIAL VARIABLES  
$0 - The filename of the current script.  
$n - These variables correspond to the arguments with which a script was invoked. Here n is a positive decimal number corresponding to the position of an argument (the first argument is $1, the second argument is $2, and so on).
$# - The number of arguments supplied to a script.  
$* - All the arguments are double quoted. If a script receives two arguments, $* is equivalent to $1 $2.  
$@ - All the arguments are individually double quoted. If a script receives two arguments, $@ is equivalent to $1 $2.  
$? - The exit status of the last command executed.  
$$ - The process number of the current shell. For shell scripts, this is the process ID under which they are executing.  
$! - The process number of the last background command.  

USING SHELL ARRAYS  
array_name[index]=value - definition  

${array_name[*]}  - all the arguments - https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/129072/whats-the-difference-between-and/129077  
${array_name[@]}  - all the arguments  

SHELL BASIC OPERATORS  
 - Arithmetic Operators  
 - Relational Operators  
 - Boolean Operators  
 - String Operators  
 - File Test Operators  
Bourne shell uses external programs - awk, expr.  
Example in test_operators_1.sh.  
Operators: +, -, *, /, %, =, == (equality), != (not equality).  
Relational Operators - 

SHELL DECISION MAKING  
Statements: if...else, case...esac.  

SHELL LOOP TYPES  
Syntax  
while command1 ; # this is loop1, the outer loop
do
   Statement(s) to be executed if command1 is true

   while command2 ; # this is loop2, the inner loop
   do
      Statement(s) to be executed if command2 is true
   done

   Statement(s) to be executed if command1 is true
done  

SHELL LOOP CONTROL  
Example in test_loop_control_1/2/3.sh
